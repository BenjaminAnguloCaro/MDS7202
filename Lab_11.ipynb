Some of them already think I’m their messiah. Others… false prophet. I must sway the non-believers. If they follow me, we can disrupt spice production. That’s the only way I can get to the Emperor.\\n[Jessica] Your father didn’t believe in revenge.\\n[Paul] Yeah, well, I do.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[indistinct whispering]\\n[Jessica] What is happening?\\n[speaking Chakobsa] Too spicy for the foreigner?\\n[Fremen laughing]\\n[Paul sighs]\\n[Jessica] What is it?\\n[Paul] There is spice in the food.\\n[woman speaks Chakobsa] He’ll look pretty with blue eyes.\\n[Fremen laughing]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Don’t mock him. He deserves our respect. He’s a good fighter. [scoffs]\\n[Stilgar] Woman. Come with me.\\n[praying watermasters chant in Chakobsa] To the well, our water we return\\n\\xa0\\n[male watermaster speaks Chakobsa] We bless our brother, Janis\\n[praying watermasters chant in Chakobsa]\\n[chanting continues]\\n[Jessica exhales deeply]\\n[Stilgar] Thirty-eight million decaliters. None of us, even dying of thirst, would ever drink this water. This is… sacred. Jamis’ water. We have a thousand such places. When we have enough water, the Lisan al-Gaib will change the face of Arrakis. He will bring back the trees. He will bring back… a Green Paradise.\\n[Jessica] [whispers] So many souls.\\n[bell rings]\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]\\n[Stilgar] [grunts] Never give your water away, not even for the dead. Hmm?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Jessica] Why are you showing me this?\\n[Stilgar] Because you are Bene Gesserit. Because you understand the prophecies. The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib will be a Reverend Mother. Our Reverend Mother is dying.\\n[Jessica] [whispers] You want me to take her place?\\n[Stilgar] Yes, I do.\\n[Jessica] You believe in Paul?\\n[Stilgar] There are signs. Yes.\\n[chanting continues in background]\\n[Jessica] What if I would refuse?\\n[Stilgar] Mmm. Then, he’s not Lisan al-Gaib, and you have no purpose to serve. What else is left to do then but to return your water to the well? [clicks tongue] Huh.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Paul] It’s an honor, isn’t it? I think you should feel honored.\\n[Jessica] Well, it was a choice between this or death, so, you know, forgive me if I’m not flattered.\\n[Paul] How does one become a Reverend Mother?\\n[Jessica] It’s different from one culture to another. Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.\\n[Paul] You’re afraid.\\n[Jessica] Reverend Mothers are tasked with holding the memories of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them, so I’ll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.\\n[Paul] Is it dangerous?\\n[Jessica] It’s lethal for men. That’s for sure.\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[suspenseful music continues playing]\\n[Jessica gasps softly]\\n[indistinct whispering, chanting]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[group laughing]\\n[Paul] What are you guys laughing about?\\n[Chani] Don’t bother. [chuckles]\\n[Paul] You don’t believe in all this?\\n[Chani] No, we don’t.\\n[Shishakli] These are old Southern beliefs.\\n[Paul] Southern beliefs?\\n[Shishakli] Southern tribes believe a messiah will come to deliver us from evil.\\n[Paul] You don’t believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?\\n[Chani] We believe in Fremen.\\n[group speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] You want to control people, you tell them a messiah will come.\\n[Shishakli] Mm-hmm.\\n[Chani] Then they’ll wait for centuries.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Stilgar] Now, we must pray.\\n[Paul] What about him?\\n[Chani] Stilgar?\\n[Paul] Mm-hmm.\\n[Chani] He’s from the South. You didn’t notice his accent?\\n[Chani and Shishakli laugh]\\n[Stilgar praying in Chakobsa]\\n[Paul] [sighs]\\n[Paul] What’ll happen to my mother?\\n[Shishakli speaking in Chakobsa] She’ll drink worm piss.\\n[group laughs]\\n[Chani speaking in Chakobsa] Not funny. He’s about to lose her.\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] If she’s stupid enough to drink poison.\\n[group laughs]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Shut up! We are praying.\\n[Fremen nuns speaking in Chakobsa]\\n[Jessica] [whispers] I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear, the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will…\\n[Fremen nuns continue speaking in Chakobsa]\\n[old watermaster speaking Chakobsa] Here is the Water of Life. It frees the soul. If you drink you shall die. If you drink you may see…\\n[speaking Chakobsa] Drink!\\n[Jessica] What is it?\\n[distorted voice] Drink!\\n[Jessica breathes heavily]\\n[indistinct whispering]\\n[Jessica grunts]\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[Jessica chokes]\\n[pained grunts]\\n[gasps]\\n[shuddering breaths]\\n[pained grunts]\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[gasps]\\n[speaking Chakobsa] What have we done. She is pregnant.\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[shudders]\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] That was no miracle!\\n[Stilgar] You saw it with your own eyes!\\n[Chani groans]\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The Mother of the Lisan al-Gaib shall survive the Holy Poison and She did. As written!\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Her people wrote that!\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Blasphemy. The prophecy has been accomplished.\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] The Mahdi must be Fremen!\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Arrakis must be freed by its own people!\\n[Paul] She’s right. She’s right! It’s no miracle. My mother was trained to do that. Poison transmutation is something advanced Bene Gesserit can do. I’m not the Mahdi. I’m not here to lead.\\n[Paul speaking Chakobsa] I’m here to learn your ways.\\n[Paul] Let me fight beside you. That’s all I’m asking.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The Mahdi is too humble to say He is the Mahdi. Even more reason to know He is! As written!\\n[Fremen speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Paul] How are you?\\n[Jessica] Better.\\n[Paul] How is she?\\n[Jessica] She was frightened, but she’s… she’s okay.\\n[Jessica breathes heavily]\\n[Jessica whispers] Paul. She talks to me. She believes in you.\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[Jessica] She says…\\n[Jessica speaking Chakobsa] Kwisatz Haderach show us the way.\\n[Jessica] You’re so close now. Only one step remains and you will become the Kwisatz Haderach. Only one step remains. You must do what I did. You must drink the Water of Life. And your mind, it’s gon– it’s gonna open and you will see.\\n[Jessica speaking Chakobsa] You will see! The beauty and the horror!\\n\\n[Stilgar] If you wanna fight with us, first thing, you must learn to be one with the desert. So, here is a tent and enough food. I want you to cross that small erg and come back. Travel by night. You know how to use a paracompass?\\n[Paul] Yes.\\n[Stilgar] Oh. [sighs]\\n[Paul] Anything else I should know?\\n[Stilgar] Uh, beside the worms and the Harkonnens, beware of the trapdoor spiders. Centipedes are very nasty. Not the big ones. They are harmless. But the little ones, you have to worry about. And… Oh! Don’t ever, ever listen to the jinn.\\n[Paul] The jinn?\\n[Stilgar] Jinn. Desert spirits. They whisper at night. [imitates Jinn whispering] They, they can possess you. Really, be careful. They are demons. [growls, laughs] But it’s true. Don’t listen to them. [grunts]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] He doesn’t know how to cross. Stilgar is going to get him killed. What is he trying to prove?\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] What do you think? “The Prophet shall know the ways of the desert.”\\n[Fremen speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] I think it’s for the best. … What’s this? You care for him now?\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] He’s not like the other strangers. He’s sincere.\\n[Jamis laughs, echoes]\\n[Paul panting]\\n[Paul] Jamis.\\n[Chani] You sandwalk like a drunk lizard.\\n[Paul] [chuckles] Yeah, I’m doing pretty good so far.\\n[Chani] Yeah, well, you’re not even in worm territory yet.\\n[Chani] You have to break up your rhythm. Like this.\\n[Paul] Now, that’s interesting because in the filmbooks I’ve studied, the anthropologists say, in order to properly sandwalk, you actually have– Never mind. Please keep going.\\n[soft music playing]\\n[Chani] You know, I’m the only one who believes you’re gonna make it until summer? Everyone else thinks you won’t make it two weeks. If you wanna follow us in the desert, you need to know how windtraps work. So, listen to me. They’re simple, but they require constant attention. Uh, this right here, it captures the moisture and then it carries it into that pocket. Uh, and these are the filters. They need to be changed every three days. What? [chuckles] Stop looking at me like that.\\n\\n[Jessica] He’s training with the Fremen. He will be back soon. Don’t worry. Mm-hmm. You’re right. If we want to protect your brother, we need all the Fremen to believe in the prophecy.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[Jessica] We must convert the non-believers one by one. We need to start with the weaker ones. The vulnerable ones. The ones who fear us.\\n[Fedaykin fighter breathes heavily]\\n[Fedaykin fighter whispers] Hey, get out of here. Go.\\n[Harkonnen soldiers speaking Harkonnen]\\n[Fedaykin fighter breathing heavily]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[blade swishing]\\n[Harkonnen soldiers and Fedaykin fighters grunt]\\n[grunting continues]\\n[Paul] You okay?\\n[Chani] Yeah.\\n[speaking Harkonnen]\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Fedaykin fighter grunts]\\n[Chani and Paul grunt, pant]\\n[Fedaykin fighter and Chani shouting in Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] Let’s go! Move!\\n[both grunt]\\n[Paul and Harkonnen soldier grunt]\\n[Chani] Load.\\n[Paul grunts]\\n[blade clanking]\\n[Harkonnen soldier shouts]\\n[Paul grunts]\\n[Paul] Chani!\\n[Chani] Reload!\\n[Chani] Ugh! Reload.\\n[Paul] Oh, watch out!\\n[both grunt, pant]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[Paul] Its shield will only open when it fires.\\n[Chani] I know that. What do you think I’m trying to do?\\n[Paul] I’ll trigger it. On my signal. Be ready.\\n[Paul] Go!\\n[Paul] [grunts] Ah, shit!\\n[Paul panting]\\n[Paul] Go! Go!\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Paul] [grunts, groans]\\n[Harkonnen soldier screams]\\n[explodes]\\n[Chani laughs]\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Chani and Paul grunt]\\n\\n[Fedaykin fighters cheering]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] You saw what he did. He saw it coming and he saved her life. He saw it. He can foresee.\\n[Shishakli sniffing] [speaking in Chakobsa] Muad’Dib likes his smell.\\n[all laughing]\\n[Chani] Who taught you to fight like that?\\n[Paul] My old masters.\\n[Chani] Hmm.\\n[Paul] They were close friends. They were massacred. Alongside my father. You’ve been fighting the Harkonnens for decades. My family’s been fighting them for centuries. I know everything about them. Their habits, their ways of thinking. You know everything about the desert. You harness the very power of it. We can stop them together, bury them in the sand where they belong. So that this planet can be yours once more.\\n[Stilgar] [deeply inhales] What would you have us do? Huh?\\n[Paul] What would you do, Stilgar?\\n[Stilgar] I? I would… [sighs] would strike even further north.\\n[Paul] Then I will go further north.\\n[Shishakli] And the further north you go, the more likely it is you die.\\n[Paul speaking Chakobsa] Then I’ll die, maybe you will too. But the others will keep going. And they won’t stop until the Fremen are free.\\n[Fedaykin fighters chattering]\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] He deserves to be Fedaykin.\\n[all agreeing]\\n[speaking Chakobsa] He needs names, Stilgar.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] He does!\\n[Stilgar] I see strength in you.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Like Usul.\\n[all agreeing]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The base of the pillar.\\n[Stilgar] Come, come.\\n[man laughing]\\n[Stilgar] You shall be know among us as Usul.\\n[man] Usul.\\n[Chani] Usul.\\n[Stilgar] Usul. And now, a Fedaykin is a fighter and needs a war name. You must choose.\\n[Paul] How do you call the, uh… The small desert mouse, again?\\n[all laughing]\\n[Stilgar] Muad’Dib?\\n[Paul] Muad’Dib.\\n[Stilgar] No, no, no. [shushes] Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert.\\nMuad’Dib… [sighs] creates his own water. The constellation that points to the North Star, we call Muad’Dib. “The One Who Points the Way.” That is a powerful name. Now you are our brother. Mmm. Paul Muad’Dib Usul.\\n[all cheering]\\n[man 1] Muad’Dib Usul.\\nMuad’Dib Usul.\\nMuad’Dib Usul.\\n[Paul and Stilgar laugh]\\nMuad’Dib Usul. Mm.\\n[man] Muad’Dib.\\n[Chani] [whispers] Usul.\\n\\n[Paul shouts] Hey! Stilgar!\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa, laughs]\\n[Paul] Father, I found my way.\\n[soft music playing]\\n[footsteps approaching]\\n[Paul] It’s breathtaking.\\n[Chani sighs]\\n[Chani] Hmm. Look. Right there. Spice. Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low. Where you’re from, does water really fall from the sky?\\n[Paul] Oh, hm, yes. Sometimes it rains for weeks on Caladan. Where you see sand here, imagine water. Our castle stands on cliffs high above the sea. If you dive in, you can’t reach the bottom.\\n[Chani] You dive in?\\n[Paul] Yes, it’s called swimming.\\n[Chani] [laughs] I don’t– I don’t believe you, Usul.\\n[Paul] Usul. What’s your secret name?\\n[Chani] Sihaya.\\n[Paul] Sihaya.\\n[Chani] Hmm.\\n[Paul] What does that mean?\\n[Chani] Means Desert Spring.\\n[Paul] “Desert Spring.” I love it.\\n[Chani] I hate it. It’s from some stupid prophecy. I prefer Chani.\\n[Paul] I prefer Chani, too, then. Do you think Stilgar would teach me?\\n[Chani] To ride?\\n[Paul] Yeah.\\n[Chani laughs] No. Only Fremen ride worms.\\n[Paul] Well, I thought I’d become one, didn’t I?\\n[Chani] By name, not by blood. Your blood comes from Dukes and Great Houses. We don’t have that here. Here, we’re equal, men and women alike. What we do, we do for the benefit of all.\\n[Paul] Well, I’d very much like to be equal to you.\\n[Chani] Paul Muad’Dib Usul… maybe you could be Fremen. Maybe I’ll show you the way.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[gun fires]\\n[explodes]\\n[all speaking Chakobsa]\\n[women screaming]\\n[bang]\\n[Baron Harkonnen] Rabban.\\n[tense music playing]\\n[breathes heavily]\\n[Baron Harkonnen] Fremen attacks on your watch.\\nYour orders were to restore spice production to full capacity.\\nDo you know what it means if you fail?\\nThe Emperor will take spice out of our control.\\nTighten your grip, Rabban.\\n[breathes heavily, whispers] Uncle.\\n[Baron Harkonnen] Or feel mine on your neck.\\n[breathes heavily, groans]\\n[Chani] Usul? Usul.\\n[Paul gasps]\\nIt’s okay. It’s okay.\\nHey.\\nI’m here, I’m here.\\nIt’s been a while since you’ve had one of those nightmares.\\nMm.\\n[Chani] Tell me, what was it about?\\n[tense music playing]\\n[Paul] Nothing’s clear. It’s only fragments.\\n[water drips]\\nI’m in the South, and I’m following someone.\\nAnd it triggers a holy war.\\nMillions and millions of people starving to death… because of me.\\n[Chani] You’ve been exposed to spice for a long time.\\nIt can create weird dreams.\\n[breathes heavily]\\nIt’s a big day.\\nWe can ask Stilgar to call it off.\\nNo. I’m fine.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Stilgar] Usul.\\nI tuned it myself.\\nHere.\\n[Paul] Thanks.\\n[sighs]\\nDon’t try to impress anyone. You are brave. We all know that.\\nHeh? Be simple.\\nBe direct. Nothing fancy.\\nNothing fancy.\\nHey, I’m serious.\\nNothing fancy or you will shame my teaching.\\nI won’t shame you. I understand.\\nShai-Hulud decides today if you become Fremen, or if you die.\\n[chuckles]\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]\\nHey, Muad’Dib!\\n[speaking Chakobsa]\\n[all laughing]\\n[Stilgar sighs]\\n[speaking Chakobsa]\\n[sighs]\\n[Paul panting]\\n[grunts]\\n[whispers] Lower.\\n[panting]\\n[grunts]\\n[panting]\\nOkay.

Year 10,191. Third comment. The battle for Arrakis took everyone by surprise. There were no witnesses.\\n[somber music playing]\\nThe Harkonnen operation was perpetrated overnight, without warning or declaration of war. By morning, the Atreides were no more. All died in the dark.\\nAnd the Emperor said… nothing. Since that night, my father has not been the same. Nor have I. His inaction is difficult for me to accept. For, I know he loved Duke Leto Atreides like a son.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[chain clanks]\\n[Irulan] But my father’s always been guided by the calculus of power. This would not be the first time the Harkonnens have done his dirty work.\\n[shouts in Harkonnen]\\n[Harkonnen army shouts]\\nIn the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets… but the darkest of them all may remain. The end of House Atreides.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Paul] Sister, Father is dead. Shouldn’t you go back to the stars, be with him?

He speaks our language. He will quickly learn our ways. I’m ready to pledge my life for him.\\n[speaking in Chakobsa] The desert will handle his fate.\\n[oldest elder sighs]\\n[oldest elder groans, speaks Chakobsa] What about the woman?\\n\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Paul] Look how your Bene Gesserit propaganda has taken root. Some of them already think I’m their messiah. Others… false prophet. I must sway the non-believers. If they follow me, we can disrupt spice production. That’s the only way I can get to the Emperor.\\n[Jessica] Your father didn’t believe in revenge.\\n[Paul] Yeah, well, I do.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[indistinct whispering]\\n[Jessica] What is happening?\\n[speaking Chakobsa] Too spicy for the foreigner?\\n[Fremen laughing]\\n[Paul sighs]\\n[Jessica] What is it?\\n[Paul] There is spice in the food.\\n[woman speaks Chakobsa] He’ll look pretty with blue eyes.\\n[Fremen laughing]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Don’t mock him.

Come with me.\\n[praying watermasters chant in Chakobsa] To the well, our water we return\\n\\xa0\\n[male watermaster speaks Chakobsa] We bless our brother, Janis\\n[praying watermasters chant in Chakobsa]\\n[chanting continues]\\n[Jessica exhales deeply]\\n[Stilgar] Thirty-eight million decaliters. None of us, even dying of thirst, would ever drink this water. This is… sacred. Jamis’ water. We have a thousand such places. When we have enough water, the Lisan al-Gaib will change the face of Arrakis. He will bring back the trees. He will bring back… a Green Paradise.\\n[Jessica] [whispers] So many souls.\\n[bell rings]\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]\\n[Stilgar] [grunts] Never give your water away, not even for the dead. Hmm?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Jessica] Why are you showing me this?\\n[Stilgar] Because you are Bene Gesserit. Because you understand the prophecies. The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib will be a Reverend Mother. Our Reverend Mother is dying.\\n[Jessica] [whispers] You want me to take her place?\\n[Stilgar] Yes, I do.\\n[Jessica] You believe in Paul?\\n[Stilgar] There are signs. Yes.\\n[chanting continues in background]\\n[Jessica] What if I would refuse?\\n[Stilgar] Mmm. Then, he’s not Lisan al-Gaib, and you have no purpose to serve. What else is left to do then but to return your water to the well? [clicks tongue] Huh.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Paul] It’s an honor, isn’t it? I think you should feel honored.\\n[Jessica] Well, it was a choice between this or death, so, you know, forgive me if I’m not flattered.\\n[Paul] How does one become a Reverend Mother?\\n[Jessica] It’s different from one culture to another. Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.\\n[Paul] You’re afraid.\\n[Jessica] Reverend Mothers are tasked with holding the memories of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them, so I’ll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.\\n[Paul] Is it dangerous?\\n[Jessica] It’s lethal for men. That’s for sure.\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[suspenseful music continues playing]\\n[Jessica gasps softly]\\n[indistinct whispering, chanting]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[group laughing]\\n[Paul] What are you guys laughing about?\\n[Chani] Don’t bother. [chuckles]\\n[Paul] You don’t believe in all this?\\n[Chani] No, we don’t.\\n[Shishakli] These are old Southern beliefs.\\n[Paul] Southern beliefs?\\n[Shishakli] Southern tribes believe a messiah will come to deliver us from evil.\\n[Paul] You don’t believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?\\n[Chani] We believe in Fremen.\\n[group speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] You want to control people, you tell them a messiah will come.\\n[Shishakli] Mm-hmm.\\n[Chani] Then they’ll wait for centuries.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Stilgar] Now, we must pray.\\n[Paul] What about him?\\n[Chani] Stilgar?\\n[Paul] Mm-hmm.\\n[Chani] He’s from the South. You didn’t notice his accent?\\n[Chani and Shishakli laugh]\\n[Stilgar praying in Chakobsa]\\n[Paul] [sighs]\\n[Paul] What’ll happen to my mother?\\n[Shishakli speaking in Chakobsa] She’ll drink worm piss.\\n[group laughs]\\n[Chani speaking in Chakobsa] Not funny. He’s about to lose her.\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] If she’s stupid enough to drink poison.\\n[group laughs]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Shut up! We are praying.\\n[Fremen nuns speaking in Chakobsa]\\n[Jessica] [whispers] I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear, the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will…\\n[Fremen nuns continue speaking in Chakobsa]\\n[old watermaster speaking Chakobsa] Here is the Water of Life. It frees the soul. If you drink you shall die. If you drink you may see…\\n[speaking Chakobsa] Drink!\\n[Jessica] What is it?\\n[distorted voice] Drink!\\n[Jessica breathes heavily]\\n[indistinct whispering]\\n[Jessica grunts]\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[Jessica chokes]\\n[pained grunts]\\n[gasps]\\n[shuddering breaths]\\n[pained grunts]\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[gasps]\\n[speaking Chakobsa] What have we done. She is pregnant.\\n[Jessica gasps]\\n[shudders]\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] That was no miracle!\\n[Stilgar] You saw it with your own eyes!\\n[Chani groans]\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The Mother of the Lisan al-Gaib shall survive the Holy Poison and She did. As written!\\n[angry, indistinct shouting]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Her people wrote that!\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Blasphemy. The prophecy has been accomplished.\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] The Mahdi must be Fremen!\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] Arrakis must be freed by its own people!\\n[Paul] She’s right. She’s right! It’s no miracle. My mother was trained to do that. Poison transmutation is something advanced Bene Gesserit can do. I’m not the Mahdi. I’m not here to lead.\\n[Paul speaking Chakobsa] I’m here to learn your ways.\\n[Paul] Let me fight beside you. That’s all I’m asking.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The Mahdi is too humble to say He is the Mahdi. Even more reason to know He is! As written!\\n[Fremen speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Paul] How are you?\\n[Jessica] Better.\\n[Paul] How is she?\\n[Jessica] She was frightened, but she’s… she’s okay.\\n[Jessica breathes heavily]\\n[Jessica whispers] Paul. She talks to me. She believes in you.\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[Jessica] She says…\\n[Jessica speaking Chakobsa] Kwisatz Haderach show us the way.\\n[Jessica] You’re so close now. Only one step remains and you will become the Kwisatz Haderach. Only one step remains. You must do what I did. You must drink the Water of Life. And your mind, it’s gon– it’s gonna open and you will see.\\n[Jessica speaking Chakobsa] You will see! The beauty and the horror!\\n\\n[Stilgar] If you wanna fight with us, first thing, you must learn to be one with the desert. So, here is a tent and enough food. I want you to cross that small erg and come back. Travel by night. You know how to use a paracompass?\\n[Paul] Yes.\\n[Stilgar] Oh. [sighs]\\n[Paul] Anything else I should know?\\n[Stilgar] Uh, beside the worms and the Harkonnens, beware of the trapdoor spiders. Centipedes are very nasty. Not the big ones. They are harmless. But the little ones, you have to worry about. And… Oh! Don’t ever, ever listen to the jinn.\\n[Paul] The jinn?\\n[Stilgar] Jinn. Desert spirits. They whisper at night. [imitates Jinn whispering] They, they can possess you. Really, be careful. They are demons. [growls, laughs] But it’s true. Don’t listen to them. [grunts]\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] He doesn’t know how to cross. Stilgar is going to get him killed. What is he trying to prove?\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] What do you think? “The Prophet shall know the ways of the desert.”\\n[Fremen speaking Chakobsa]\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] I think it’s for the best. … What’s this? You care for him now?\\n[Chani speaking Chakobsa] He’s not like the other strangers. He’s sincere.\\n[Jamis laughs, echoes]\\n[Paul panting]\\n[Paul] Jamis.\\n[Chani] You sandwalk like a drunk lizard.\\n[Paul] [chuckles] Yeah, I’m doing pretty good so far.\\n[Chani] Yeah, well, you’re not even in worm territory yet.\\n[Chani] You have to break up your rhythm. Like this.\\n[Paul] Now, that’s interesting because in the filmbooks I’ve studied, the anthropologists say, in order to properly sandwalk, you actually have– Never mind. Please keep going.\\n[soft music playing]\\n[Chani] You know, I’m the only one who believes you’re gonna make it until summer? Everyone else thinks you won’t make it two weeks. If you wanna follow us in the desert, you need to know how windtraps work. So, listen to me. They’re simple, but they require constant attention. Uh, this right here, it captures the moisture and then it carries it into that pocket. Uh, and these are the filters. They need to be changed every three days. What? [chuckles] Stop looking at me like that.\\n\\n[Jessica] He’s training with the Fremen. He will be back soon. Don’t worry. Mm-hmm. You’re right. If we want to protect your brother, we need all the Fremen to believe in the prophecy.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[Jessica] We must convert the non-believers one by one. We need to start with the weaker ones. The vulnerable ones. The ones who fear us.\\n[Fedaykin fighter breathes heavily]\\n[Fedaykin fighter whispers] Hey, get out of here. Go.\\n[Harkonnen soldiers speaking Harkonnen]\\n[Fedaykin fighter breathing heavily]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[blade swishing]\\n[Harkonnen soldiers and Fedaykin fighters grunt]\\n[grunting continues]\\n[Paul] You okay?\\n[Chani] Yeah.\\n[speaking Harkonnen]\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Fedaykin fighter grunts]\\n[Chani and Paul grunt, pant]\\n[Fedaykin fighter and Chani shouting in Chakobsa]\\n[Chani] Let’s go! Move!\\n[both grunt]\\n[Paul and Harkonnen soldier grunt]\\n[Chani] Load.\\n[Paul grunts]\\n[blade clanking]\\n[Harkonnen soldier shouts]\\n[Paul grunts]\\n[Paul] Chani!\\n[Chani] Reload!\\n[Chani] Ugh! Reload.\\n[Paul] Oh, watch out!\\n[both grunt, pant]\\n[Harkonnen soldier speaking Harkonnen]\\n[Paul] Its shield will only open when it fires.\\n[Chani] I know that. What do you think I’m trying to do?\\n[Paul] I’ll trigger it. On my signal. Be ready.\\n[Paul] Go!\\n[Paul] [grunts] Ah, shit!\\n[Paul panting]\\n[Paul] Go! Go!\\n[rapid gunfire]\\n[Paul] [grunts, groans]\\n[Harkonnen soldier screams]\\n[explodes]\\n[Chani laughs]\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Chani and Paul grunt]\\n\\n[Fedaykin fighters cheering]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] You saw what he did. He saw it coming and he saved her life. He saw it. He can foresee.\\n[Shishakli sniffing] [speaking in Chakobsa] Muad’Dib likes his smell.\\n[all laughing]\\n[Chani] Who taught you to fight like that?\\n[Paul] My old masters.\\n[Chani] Hmm.\\n[Paul] They were close friends. They were massacred. Alongside my father. You’ve been fighting the Harkonnens for decades. My family’s been fighting them for centuries. I know everything about them. Their habits, their ways of thinking. You know everything about the desert. You harness the very power of it. We can stop them together, bury them in the sand where they belong. So that this planet can be yours once more.\\n[Stilgar] [deeply inhales] What would you have us do? Huh?\\n[Paul] What would you do, Stilgar?\\n[Stilgar] I? I would… [sighs] would strike even further north.\\n[Paul] Then I will go further north.\\n[Shishakli] And the further north you go, the more likely it is you die.\\n[Paul speaking Chakobsa] Then I’ll die, maybe you will too. But the others will keep going. And they won’t stop until the Fremen are free.\\n[Fedaykin fighters chattering]\\n[Shishakli speaking Chakobsa] He deserves to be Fedaykin.\\n[all agreeing]\\n[speaking Chakobsa] He needs names, Stilgar.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] He does!\\n[Stilgar] I see strength in you.\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] Like Usul.\\n[all agreeing]\\n[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa] The base of the pillar.\\n[Stilgar] Come, come.\\n[man laughing]\\n[Stilgar] You shall be know among us as Usul.\\n[man] Usul.\\n[Chani] Usul.\\n[Stilgar] Usul. And now, a Fedaykin is a fighter and needs a war name. You must choose.\\n[Paul] How do you call the, uh… The small desert mouse, again?\\n[all laughing]\\n[Stilgar] Muad’Dib?\\n[Paul] Muad’Dib.\\n[Stilgar] No, no, no. [shushes] Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert.\\nMuad’Dib… [sighs] creates his own water. The constellation that points to the North Star, we call Muad’Dib. “The One Who Points the Way.” That is a powerful name. Now you are our brother. Mmm. Paul Muad’Dib Usul.\\n[all cheering]\\n[man 1] Muad’Dib Usul.\\nMuad’Dib Usul.\\nMuad’Dib Usul.\\n[Paul and Stilgar laugh]\\nMuad’Dib Usul. Mm.\\n[man] Muad’Dib.\\n[Chani] [whispers] Usul.\\n\\n[Paul shouts] Hey! Stilgar!\\n[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa, laughs]\\n[Paul] Father, I found my way.\\n[soft music playing]\\n[footsteps approaching]\\n[Paul] It’s breathtaking.\\n[Chani sighs]\\n[Chani] Hmm. Look. Right there. Spice. Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low. Where you’re from, does water really fall from the sky?\\n[Paul] Oh, hm, yes. Sometimes it rains for weeks on Caladan. Where you see sand here, imagine water. Our castle stands on cliffs high above the sea. If you dive in, you can’t reach the bottom.\\n[Chani] You dive in?\\n[Paul] Yes, it’s called swimming.\\n[Chani] [laughs] I don’t– I don’t believe you, Usul.\\n[Paul] Usul. What’s your secret name?\\n[Chani] Sihaya.\\n[Paul] Sihaya.\\n[Chani] Hmm.\\n[Paul] What does that mean?\\n[Chani] Means Desert Spring.\\n[Paul] “Desert Spring.” I love it.\\n[Chani] I hate it. It’s from some stupid prophecy. I prefer Chani.\\n[Paul] I prefer Chani, too, then.
